  I am currently employed as a data scientist at [IDG Institut f√ºr digitale Gesundheitsdaten RLP gGmbH](https://www.idg-rlp.de/) where I work with R shiny. I love the statistical programming language R, reading and music.

  I studied business administration and economics with a strong focus on statistical programming. I like creating self-study tutorials. You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/philippleppert). 

  I live in Mainz with my wife.

  This blog is built with [blogdown](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), and deployed using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). My illustrated portrait was drawn by [Liza Donnely](https://twitter.com/lizadonnelly).
