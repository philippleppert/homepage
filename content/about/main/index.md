  As a data scientist I use [shiny](https://www.rstudio.com/products/shiny/) and [shiny server](https://posit.co/products/open-source/shinyserver/) as end-to-end solution for creating and deploying dashboards. I am also interested in data engineering and data analysis topics. I'm a fan of self-study tutorials and you can find some of my own over [here](/tutorials/).
  
  I studied business administration and economics with a focus on statistics and statistical programming. 

  I was born in Thuringia und currently live in Mainz with my wife.

  This website is built with [blogdown](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), and deployed using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). My illustrated portrait was drawn by cartoonist [Liza Donnely](https://lizadonnelly.com/).
